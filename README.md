## ℹ️ Frequently asked questions ℹ️ 

- *Can I run the workshop on my computer?*

> There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine.
> If you do so, you will need
> * [node 15 and npm 7 or later](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/update-node-js/)
> * netlify-cli (use "npm install -g netlify-cli")

> You will have to adapt commands and paths based on your environment and install the dependencies by yourself. **We won't provide support** to keep on track with schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to be successful. **This is considered a more advanced path to take.**

- *What other prerequisites are there?*
> * You will need a github account
> * You will need an Astra DB account, but we'll work through that in the exercises
> * Use **Chrome** or **Firefox** for the best experience.

- *Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?*
> * **No.** All tools and services we provide here are FREE.

- *Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?*
