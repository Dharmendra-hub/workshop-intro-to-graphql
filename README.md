*50 minutes, Beginner/Intermediate, [Start Building](#1-login-or-register-to-astradb-and-create-database)*

Both a simple **graphQL** enabled **ReactJS** app built using [**create-react-app**](https://create-react-app.dev/) AND a simple **Java** backend **graphQL** service built with [**Spring Intializer**](https://start.spring.io/) and using [**The Netflix DGS framework**](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/getting-started/) PLUS **Astra DB** hooked up and ready to rock! :heart_eyes_cat:

This is a companion to our [Netflix Clone using Astra DB and GraphQL](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/appdev-week3-graphql) workshop and is essentially a "prologue" to that content. Once complete, feel free to to go deploy a Netflix clone using what you learned here.

Finally, this content uses **React/JS** concepts. If you are not familiar with those or need a refresher, [take a look HERE](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/react-basics) to get up to date.

The materials have been built by the Datastax developer advocates team.

# Part 1 - DB Setup & Data Ingest

## 1. Login or Register to AstraDB and create database

> *When creating your instance use the promotion code **ANIA200** to get 200$ of free credit allowing you about 30 million writes + 30 Million reads  + 50GB a month of monthly storage!!*

**`ASTRADB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, FREE for roughly 5M writes, 30M reads, 40GB storage monthly - sufficient to run small production workloads.  

‚úÖ **Step 1a:** Click the button to login or register with Datastax. You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`.

_Make sure to chose a password with minimum 8 characters, containing upper and lowercase letters, at least one number and special character_

<a href="https://astra.dev/7-22"><img src="tutorial/images/create_astra_db.png?raw=true" /></a>
- <details><summary>Show me!</summary>
    <img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-spring-stargate/raw/main/images/tutorials/astra-create-db.gif?raw=true" />
</details>

**Use the following values when creating the database**
|Field| Value|
|---|---|
|**database name**| `netflix_workshop_db` |
|**keyspace**| `netflix_keyspace` |
|**Cloud Provider**| *Use the one you like, click a cloud provider logo,  pick an Area in the list and finally pick a region.* |

_You can technically use whatever you want and update the code to reflect the keyspace. This is really to get you on a happy path for the first run._

You will see your new database `pending` OR `initializing` in the Dashboard.

![image](./tutorial/images/db-pending.png?raw=true)

The status will change to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 2. Create a security token

‚úÖ  **Step 2a:**  [Create a token for your app](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/docs/manage-application-tokens.html) to use in the settings screen. Use "Database Administrator" permission.

‚úÖ  **Step 2b:**  Copy the token value (eg `AstraCS:KDfdKeNREyWQvDpDrBqwBsUB:ec80667c....`) in your clipboard and save the CSV, this value would not be provided afterward.

## 3. Launch Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is an 100% online IDE based on [VS Code](https://github.com/gitpod-io/vscode/blob/gp-code/LICENSE.txt?lang=en-US). To initialize your environment simply click on the button below _(CTRL + Click to open in new tab)_ You will be asked for you github account, as needed.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-intro-to-graphql)

This will startup your demo environment. Be patient, it will take a couple minutes as everything loads up.

## 4. Experiment with GraphiQL
It just so happens that [The Netflix DGS framework](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/getting-started/) comes with GraphiQL already integrated and ready for use. This is a wonderful tool you can use to explore graphQL queries and mutations. Let's experiement with this now!

#### Here's the schema defined in our java backend per `graphql-backend-examples/src/main/resources/schema/schema.graphqls/schema.graphqls`

```GraphQL
type Query {
    shows(titleFilter: String): [Show]
    genres(labelFilter: String): [Genre]
}

type Show {
    title: String
    releaseYear: Int
}

type Genre {
    value: String!
}
```

#### Now, let's try out some graphQL queries

```GraphQL
query justTitle {
  shows {
    title
  }
}
```

```GraphQL
query withReleaseYear {
  shows {
    title
    releaseYear
  }
}
```

```GraphQL
query ShowsAndGenres {
  shows {
    title
    releaseYear
  }
  genres {
    value
  }
}
```

## 5. Start up React
Ok, so we've played a bit with some graphQL queries on the backend and looked at how a basic schema works, but how do we hook this into our React JS app?

#### First, we need to run a couple commands to get things setup
In your **`GitPod`** IDE navigate to the **`workshop-intro-to-graphql/graphql-client-examples`** terminal on the bottom right *(it should already be open for you)*.

#### ‚úÖ  Execute the following command
```shell
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

This will install the **Netlify CLI** (command line interface) which our **React/JS** app uses in conjunction with the serverless functions we've setup to talk to our **graphQL** endpoints.

#### ‚úÖ  Then, execute
```shell
netlify dev
```

This will start the **React/JS** application and display results from both the **`Shows`** and **`Genres`** **graphQL** queries and endpoints we were just experimenting with.

#### Compare javascript code to our graphQL queries from above
If you take a look at both **`getShowsBackend.js`** and **`getGenresBackend.js`** located in **`graphql-client-examples/functions`** you should notice that both use the **same exact** **graphQL** queries that we used above.

```javascript
const query = `
    query getAllShows {
      shows {
        title
        releaseYear
      }
    }
  `
  ```

  ```javascript
  const query = `
    query getAllGenres {
      genres {
        value
      }
    }
  `
  ```

  All of the javascript wrapped around these is simply there to call the **graphQL** endpoint with the given query and pass the responseBody back to the calling function.

  #### Now for the cool part
  Take a look at **`Shows.js`** and **`Genres.js`** located in **`graphql-client-examples/src/components/Shows.js`**. In both cases they use **React** state, `shows` and `genres` respectively
  ```javascript
  const [shows, setShows] = useState(null)
  ```

  ```javascript
  const [genres, setGenres] = useState(null)
  ```

to receive the responseBody from from our **graphQL** queries, set the **React** state, and inject the values dyanmically into the DOM.

Notice how the fields (title, releaseYear) match our **graphQL** `Shows` schema exactly.
```javascript
return shows.map(({ title, releaseYear }) => (
        <div key={title}>
            <p>
            {title}: {releaseYear}
            </p>
        </div>
    ));
```

Notice how the field (value) matches our **graphQL** `Genres` schema exactly.
```javascript
return genres.map(({ value }) => (
          <div key={value}>
              <p>
              {value}
              </p>
          </div>
      ));
```

## 6. Hook up the data layer with Astra DB
Ok, let's take this a step further and hook our app up to a data layer. As this point you should have already created your Astra DB database. Follow the instructions below to launch the **GraphQL Playground** provided in **Astra**

‚úÖ  **Step 6a:** Open **GraphQL Playground** by 
1. Click on your active database
2. Click `Connect` TAB
3. Click `GRAPHQL API`
4. Click link to your playground.

*As show on the picture below.*
![image](tutorial/images/open-playground.png?raw=true)

> *Note that values in the picture do no reflect the database name `netflix_workshop_db`, reason is we do not reproduce every picture each time*

‚úÖ  **Step 6b:** In GraphQL Playground, **Populate HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below

![image](tutorial/images/graphql-playground.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 6c:** In GraphQL Playground, create a table with the following mutation, making sure to replace `netflix_keyspace` if you used a different name:

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel
```yaml
mutation {
  reference_list: createTable(
    keyspaceName:"netflix_keyspace",
    tableName:"reference_list",
    ifNotExists:true
    partitionKeys: [ 
      { name: "label", type: {basic: TEXT} }
    ]
    clusteringKeys: [
      { name: "value", type: {basic: TEXT}, order: "ASC" }
    ]
  )
}
```
* Use the arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

## 7. Insert data in the Table with GraphQL

‚úÖ  **Step 7a:** In graphQL playground, change tab to now use `graphql`. Edit the end of the URl to change from `system` to the name of your keyspace: `netflix_keyspace`

‚úÖ  **Step 7b:** Populate **HTTP HEADER** variable `x-cassandra-token` on the bottom of the page with your token as shown below (again !! yes this is not the same tab)

![image](tutorial/images/graphql-playground-2.png?raw=true)

‚úÖ  **Step 7c:** In GraphQL Playground,populate the `reference_list` table with the following values

- Copy the following mutation on the left panel

```yaml
mutation insertGenres {
  action: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Action"}) {
    value{value}
  }
  anime: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Anime"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  award: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Award-Winning"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  children: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Children & Family"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  comedies: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Comedies"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  documentaries: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Documentaries"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  drama: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Dramas"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  fantasy: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Fantasy"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  french: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"French"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  horror: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Horror"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  independent: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Independent"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  music: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Music & Musicals"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  romance: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Romance"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  scifi: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Sci-Fi"}) {
     value{value}
  }
  thriller: insertreference_list(value: {label:"genre", value:"Thriller"}) {
     value{value}
  }  
}
```

* Use the arrow in the middle of the screen to execute the query

## 8. Retrieving list of values

‚úÖ  **Step 5a:** In GraphQL Playground, not changing tab (yeah) list values from the table with the following query.

```yaml
query getAllGenre {
    reference_list (value: {label:"genre"}) {
      values {
      	value
      }
    }
}
```

*üëÅÔ∏è Expected output*
